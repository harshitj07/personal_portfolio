			Since 2018, I have developed a strong interest in computers and technology, initially sparked by the rapid advancement of new technologies and my curiosity about computer programming. By taking various courses and independently learning outside the classroom, I have worked on numerous projects, including developing apps, games, and websites. These experiences deepened my passion for programming and solidified my decision to pursue a career centered around computers and technology.

				<br>
				<br>
				A slot machine–style game built for iOS, focusing on randomness, animations, and game-style UI design.<br><br>
				
				What It Does:<br>
				- Simulates a slot machine using randomized outcomes<br>
				- Updates score or credits based on results<br>
				- Uses visual feedback to enhance gameplay<br><br>

				What I Learned:<br>
			    - Applying randomness and logic in Swift<br>
				- Designing simple game mechanics for mobile platforms<br>
				- Enhancing UX through animations and visual cues<br><br>

				<br>
				<br>
				A digital implementation of the classic War card game, designed as a turn-based iOS application.<br><br>
				
				What It Does:<br>
				- Simulates card draws for two players<br>
				- Compares card values to determine round winners<br>
				- Tracks game progression and results<br><br>

				What I Learned:<br>
			    - Modeling game logic and rules in Swift<br>
				- Structuring reusable components for card-based games<br>
				- Translating traditional games into interactive mobile apps<br><br>
