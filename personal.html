			Since 2018, I have grown a strong liking to computers and technology. Initially this was sparked by the new technology that was coming out and my liking to computer programming. By taking different classes and studying on my on, I was able to work on many projects and start developing apps, games, and websites. This experience allowed me to grow a liking towards programming and computers and I was able to make the decision that my career path would revolve around this.

				Growing up with the rise of technology and the development of easier languages, I was constantly exposed to the realm of programming by my parents. By joining a coding class I was able to dive deeper into the world of making games using coding languages. I did this through the use of Pygame Zero with Python. With Python being one of the easiest and most capable programming languages, I was able to create different games and work around the fundamentals of programming. This experience allowed me to better comprehend the basics of programming and its components such as variables and loops, but also allowed me to understand how to manipulate the language to my liking. Additionally, I also helped nurture my yearn to problem solve and harness my creative thinking skills. When an error would occur with the program, I was able to go through it step-by-step and identify what may be causing it, alongside fixing the given issue. This was the gateway to my desire to work in the field of technology and it truly allowed me to later explore new languages and different things to do with those languages aside from making games.

				After being well exposed with Python and other languages that would work by displaying its output on my computer, I quickly realized the capabilities of technological components. I decided to dive deeper into hardware and soon understood the importance of making programs that run hardware components. By learning the basics of C++ and the functionality of a microcontroller such as an Arduino, I was able to understand the power behind building programs for a practical purpose. I was able to create projects that had a purpose. For example, I created a module that would calculate how tall you were using an ultrasonic sensor and mathematics. I was also able to create a digital safe and an automatic clothing folder for my summative projects in school. This experience allowed me to understand the capabilities of microcontrollers and physical technological components as it served a purpose that could have streamline your day-to-day lives.

				My exposure to programming allowed me to quickly look at the route to success with the least amount of learning involved. This is where HTML and CSS came into play. With the languages being written in essentially plain English, I was able to understand its functionality very quickly and create beautiful and well crafted web pages online. This knowledge helped me down the line as I took a course in Grade 10 that covered the basics of computer programming using HTML, CSS, and PHP. By using these languages I was able to create games, and programs online that would be displayed in intriguing and appealing ways due to my excellence in design and creativity. This exposure allowed me to understand the visual aspect to computer programming and how it can be utilized to create web pages and digital sites for others to interact with.

				The peak of my journey with programming has been my focus on designing apps with Swift. With my personal goal being to work at Apple one day, dabbling in programming with Swift allowed me to explore both the back-end and front-end aspect of developing and making apps that have a purpose. Once I had the foundations set, I was able to create a few apps that were well designed and interesting for the user. Among these were a calculator app which looks nearly identical to the stock Apple app, a few games that cover the gaming aspect and recreational factor of making apps, and also a Landmarks app created directly from an Apple course that shows the beauty of app development and how you can use it to integrate vital information and useful data for the user. Voyaging through this allowed me to get a small glimpse into what the developers at Apple and other companies may be doing for their own software.
