			In school I was able to further explore the idea of engineering and computer programming in my Computer Engineering and Computer Science classes. With Computer Engineering we were given the ability to explore computer hardware, networking, electronics, coding, and other bits of information that are discussed in the field. With this experience, I was able to further hone in on my career path and create some interesting projects that would have a valid purpose behind them. With Computer Science, I was given the opportunity to make websites and develop programs using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.

				The device that I created for my summative project was an Automatic Shirt Folder. My idea is very straightforward and it has the purpose to essentially fold clothing. Primarily, I am focusing on different types of shirts and polos but ideally, it can also be utilized for pants and other articles of clothing depending on how you utilize the machine and what your needs are. My device has a practical purpose and helps solve a real world problem that is often a hassle in your day-to-day life.

				For my Computer Science Course in Grade 11, we were given the opportunity to work with website building. We began the course with the basics regarding the languages that we were going to use; HTML, CSS, and PHP. We then were given the opportunity to customize and create a template for ourselves that we could use for future assignments that would help display our skills and help complete tasks. This course not only allowed me to delve deeper into website building itself, but also allowed me to look at the work going on behind the scenes, and be able to manipulate code to make it look appealing and intriguing.
