			In Grade 12, the Global Innovator’s Toolkit focused on integrating related STEM disciplines to deepen our understanding of how concepts connect in real-world applications. This year emphasized interdisciplinary learning, allowing us to combine coursework across subjects and develop larger, more cohesive projects. Through collaborative work, long-term summatives, and applied problem-solving, we continued to expand our technical toolkit while strengthening our ability to connect theory with practical implementation.

	<h2>Calculus-Physics Bundle</h2>

				This bundle combined calculus and physics into a unified learning experience, allowing us to apply mathematical concepts directly to physical systems. A major joint summative project formed the core of the semester. As part of this project, we took a trip to Canada’s Wonderland, where we collected real-world motion data from rides. This data was used to analyze derivatives in motion while also answering a major physics question of our choosing in group settings. The project helped bridge abstract calculus concepts with observable physical behavior, reinforcing the connection between mathematical modeling and real-world motion.

				This bundle linked computer engineering and computer science through a shared server-based project. The computer engineering component focused on setting up and configuring the network infrastructure, while the computer science component involved hosting and managing a website on the server. Files and documentation were provided to support the project. For the computer science portion, I chose to host my personal portfolio on the server, allowing me to apply web development, server configuration, and deployment concepts in a practical environment. This project highlighted how hardware, networking, and software work together within real systems.
