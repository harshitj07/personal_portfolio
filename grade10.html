			In Grade 10, I developed entrepreneurship skills alongside engineering concepts and the design thinking process. We worked with businesses, technology, and real-world constraints, culminating in projects focused on creating and pitching original ideas. These experiences strengthened my leadership, collaboration, and problem-solving skills while working in team-based environments.

				For the first project of the year, we partnered with the Youth Philanthropy Initiative (YPI), where we competed for a $5,000 grant to award to a charity of our choice. Working in groups, we researched potential charities, conducted interviews with representatives, and evaluated their impact on the community. We then presented our findings to peers and teachers, who selected the organizations to receive funding. Although our group was not chosen, the project was highly educational and helped me develop confidence in public speaking, research, and professional communication through interviewing adults working in nonprofit organizations.

				This project focused on solving environmental challenges through robotics and hardware-based design. Using a provided framework, we were encouraged to innovate and expand upon an initial concept. Due to material constraints, I worked in a pair to develop an Advanced Agriculture system. Our solution was an automated plant watering system enhanced with sensor data collection and app-based control. The system used multiple sensors to monitor plant conditions and displayed real-time data through a connected application, allowing users to control watering remotely. The final prototype functioned reliably, and the project strengthened my experience with robotics, sensors, and microcontroller-based systems, as well as my ability to communicate technical ideas through a short presentation video.

				For the final project of the year, we combined our engineering, design, and entrepreneurship skills to develop a business idea aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). After brainstorming and pitching ideas individually, we formed teams with complementary skill sets and selected a concept focused on improving access to education globally. Our team proposed a platform that aggregates online educational tools and resources to help users achieve their academic goals. By the end of the project, we developed a marketing website, a social media presence, and a fully designed application prototype using Figma. The project received strong academic results and helped me develop key entrepreneurial skills, including leadership, critical thinking, collaboration, and effective communication.
