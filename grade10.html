			In Grade 10, we explored and developed entrepreneurship skills that related to engineering concepts and the design thinking process. We worked with businesses and technology and our final project focused on creating a business/idea of our own. These projects helped us develop ideas which were geared towards entrepreneurship and leadership skills while working with a team.

				For the first project of the year, we were given the opportunity to partner up with the “Youth Philanthropy Initiative'' to receive a grant of $5000 dollars to give to a charity of our choice. For this project, we were grouped up and given the task to find a charity that we felt was doing good to the world. We spent some time researching and interviewing them to gain some valuable information on why they should get the grant. After doing this, we presented our charity in front of others and the teachers chose which group would get the grant. Unfortunately, our group was not amongst those chosen for the grant although this was nevertheless a very educational project. This project helped us improve our presenting skills and helped us get out of our comfort zone and interview adults working at charities.

				For our second project of the year, we were given the opportunity to work with hardware to develop a solution to problems in our environment. We were given a framework to follow to build a certain design and then were given the opportunity to innovate and expand upon that to build something unique. Initially we were to work individually for this project although due to certain circumstances and shortage of materials, we were given the opportunity to work in groups of 2. I partnered up with somebody and we tried to work on the “Advanced Agriculture” module. Ths module focused on building an automatic plant watering system and my partner and I decided to innovate on this idea by adding an app which controlled the watering system and also hooked up to certain sensors which collected data from the plant and displayed it onto the app. We performed quite well at this project and the prototype worked quite seamlessly in the end. This project helped us develop our robotic skills since we worked with numerous sensors and a microbit. It also improved our presentation skills since we were to present this project in a short video at the end.

				For our final project this year, we were given the opportunity to combine all of our skills from the past school year and use the thinking to generate an idea for a business. We were provided a general framework but the main focus of the project was to work with UN SDG goals and innovation. Initially we were given some time to brainstorm ideas and create pitches. We were then told to get into groups with people who had different skills from us. After partnering up, we decided on an idea and our team chose to help the education system worldwide. Our plan was to create a platform which gathered tools from the internet and help you succeed with your education based goals. By the end of our project we had created a marketing website, a social media page which displayed our idea, and an app built on Figma which showed our design. We received high marks on this project and gained vital skills relating to entrepreneurship such as leadership, communication, and critical thinking.
