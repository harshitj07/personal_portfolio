			In Grade 9, I developed foundational innovation skills through engineering and design thinking. I worked on inventing, designing, and building solutions aimed at addressing real-world problems within the community. These experiences helped shape my mindset toward creativity, critical thinking, and effective project management.

				This was our first major project of Grade 9 and introduced us to the I-STEM program through hands-on learning. The project integrated multiple areas of science as we designed and built bottle rockets and model rockets. Through this experience, I became familiar with the I-STEM toolkit, safety procedures, and project requirements, while also learning key principles of rocketry such as fin design, stability, and optimal component placement. This project helped build confidence working with tools and set the foundation for future engineering projects.

				The Local Issue Project was our first community-focused project, centered on identifying and addressing a real-world issue within Hamilton Harbour. My group and I analyzed several local challenges and focused on problems within the city’s sewer system. After researching runoff patterns and infrastructure limitations, we designed and prototyped an advanced sewer system concept aimed at reducing water flow and improving filtration before runoff entered the harbour. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of urban geography, stormwater runoff, and the chemical interactions that occur when pollutants enter open water systems.

				This project challenged us to design a solution for an elderly individual living with multiple disabilities. The same design prompt is used for first-year engineering students at McMaster University, making the project both rigorous and meaningful. After identifying key challenges he faced, our group focused on enabling him to play board games with his son, approaching the problem with empathy and user-centered design. We built a functional robotic system capable of moving board game pieces and rolling interactive dice. Through this project, I developed stronger design-thinking skills and gained a deeper understanding of how engineering solutions can improve accessibility and quality of life.

				This project provided the freedom to work in self-selected teams and design a solution to a real-world problem of our choosing. My group chose to enhance the functionality of a standard whiteboard eraser by adding marker storage, a replaceable cleaning cloth, and a built-in spray mechanism. We designed and 3D-printed our prototype, which functioned effectively in practice. The project was recognized as one of the top eight projects in the entire grade, and it allowed us to apply the full range of skills learned throughout the year while clearly demonstrating our design process using the I-STEM toolkit.
