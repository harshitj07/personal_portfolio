			In Grade 11, I further developed my skills through the Global Innovator’s Toolkit, with a focus on earning micro-credentials and addressing large-scale global issues. Early coursework emphasized research, systems thinking, and problem analysis, while the primary project of the year centered on the global issue of housing insecurity and homelessness. With an extended project timeline of over two months, we were challenged to design an innovative solution that could meaningfully support individuals facing housing insecurity within our local community. This experience strengthened my leadership, collaboration, and creative problem-solving skills while working toward a socially impactful solution.

				For our major project this year, we were given a significant amount of time to formulate our ideas and gradually build toward a final product. We began by completing several modules focused on researching governance in our region, building empathy, and determining our primary approach to addressing the housing crisis. Once this foundation was established, we pitched our idea to others and received valuable feedback, which we used to iterate on our design and form a solid basis for our solution. The remainder of the project followed a self-paced structure, during which we designed a prototype and created sketches illustrating how the model would function in the real world. The project concluded with a presentation and proposal that we shared during a showcase at the end of the semester. Through this experience, we gained a stronger understanding of how real-world projects operate, particularly in terms of organization and managing our work at a comfortable pace to meet deadlines.
