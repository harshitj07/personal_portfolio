			In Grade 11, we developed our skills in regards to microcredentials and solving global issues. The first few assignments we worked on regarded micro-credentials and our big project for the semester was a global issue, homelessness. With this project we were given more than 2 months to devise an innovative model that would help solve the housing insecurity crisis and help people in our locality. This helped us develop key leadership skills when working as a team and also helped us work with our creativity to make a unique and innovative solution that would truly help our communities.

				For our big project this year, we had a lot of time to formulate our thoughts and build up to what would be our final product. To begin with, we finished many modules that regarded researching governance in our region, building empathy, and determining our primary focus for how we were going to solve the housing crisis. Once we had the basics done, we pitched our idea to others and got valuable feedback that we used to help iterate our design and formulate a basis for our solution. The rest of the project consisted of a self-paced period to design a prototype and create sketches for how the model would function in the real world. Eventually, we made a presentation and a proposal which we shared to others in a showcase at the end of the semester. This project helped us truly get a feel of how things work in the real world as we gained lots of knowledge in terms of organization and working at a pace that you were comfortable with to meet deadlines.
